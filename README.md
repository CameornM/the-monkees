# The Monkees

### User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

#### Goal of the Project

The project that I made was to create a website for a band called "The Monkees". The point of the website is to showcase their songs, videos and pictures of the bandmembers. Also help them promote themselves on their social medias specifically YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. 

## Technologies Used
- CSS
- HTML
- Bootstrap v4.2.1

## Testing
Throughout my project I've been testing on different devices making sure that it can go fluidly from large screens (desktop), to medium (iPad, iPad Pro) to small (Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8 + plus, iPhone X) to make sure that the site will be able to be used on 
all devices. I did this by using the inspect element and cycling through responsive, to various mobile devices making sure even the smallest screens will be compatible with this website. I ran into a few problems with the photos overlapping the 
footer, so I had to move the margins and the padding to make sure on all devices it would stay compatible and have a fluid design to it.

## Features
I'm happy with the "jump to" feature on the about page so it's easy to navigate around. Would be very useful for larger pages but for this it serves a nice purpose to easily get to the section that the viewer wants to see. 

I like the subtle change and transition on the buttons on the footer, allowing a fluid experience and knowing when you hover over the icon

### Features to improve on

For the future, I'd want to improve on the carousel to make sure it was working fluently, to do this I'd make sure the images were all compatible with one another so there wasnt as much jumping, and overall the image would look better rather than having size changes. I had to move this to the side as for the images I had it wasn't a good way to 
present it 

Had problems with the Image on the title page and it not covering / staying a fixed size.
## Content

All sections on "The Monkees" was written by me.

### Credit

The template for the navbar and contact form were taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/).

They were both modified to suit the website after using the template.
