# The Monkees

**User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project**
 

The project that I made was to create a website for a band called "The Monkees". The point of the website is to showcase their songs and help them promote themselves as a band. 

## Technologies Used
- CSS
- HTML
- Bootstrap v4.2.1

## Testing
Throughout my project I've been testing on different devices making sure that it can go fluidly from large screens, to medium to small to make sure that the site will be able to be used on 
all devices. I did this by using the inspect element and cycling through responsive, to various mobile devices making sure even the smallest screens will be compatible with this website. I ran into a few problems with the photos overlapping the 
footer, so I had to move the margins and the padding to make sure on all devices it would stay compatible and have a fluid design to it.
